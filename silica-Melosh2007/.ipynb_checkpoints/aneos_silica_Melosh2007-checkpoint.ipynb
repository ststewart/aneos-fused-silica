This notebook produces plots of the equation of state surface and comparisons to experimental data and ab initio calculations.\n",

    "    \n",
    "The reference state is the solid ($\\alpha$-quartz) at STP. In ANEOS, the liquid model is a modification of the solid model. As a compromise to span the whole phase diagram, the solid does not represent the true polymorphs of SiO$_2$. The solid phases are simplified into two phases: a low-pressure phase and a denser, high-pressure phase. The heat capacity adjustment parameter is adjusted to match the estimated heat capacity of the liquid as determined from shock temperature data (Millot et al. Science 2015). The calculated shock temperatures provide a good fit to the data but the calculated entropies fall a little short of the calculation by Kraus et al. 2012. The Debye temperature is fitted to attain the desired specific entropy at boiling at 1 bar. The temperatures in the liquid field are much improved with the adjusted heat capacity compared to previous ANEOS models using the Dulong-Petit limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This high-pressure phase transition introduces artificial discontinuities in the liquid field and along the melt curve. This model becomes increasingly erroneous for shock pressures above about 800-1000 GPa as the curvature on the Hugoniot and the Grueneisen parameter are not correct at extremely high densities. The functional form for the Gruneisen parameter in ANEOS has difficulty matching the properties of silicate liquids, and this model does not approach the Thomas-Fermi limit.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpolation procedure to make the GADGET2 density-entropy-grid table uses linear interpolation on the same density grid as the density-temperature SESAME table to obtain the EOS values at each GADGET2 entropy grid point. This method introduces substantial errors in the vapor dome. <p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The calculated vapor curve is skewed with a high temperature and low density, although it is close to the 1 bar values. <p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>MODEL DEVELOPMENT QUALITY (MDQ) RATING</b><br>\n",
    "We provide an MDQ rating which is saved as a 301-style SESAME table. The MDQ rating is a qualitative guide for users that provides some known quality control information. This information is necessarily subjective and incomplete. The rating does not guarantee any fidelity in the EOS model except for points that have been directly compared to experimental data in the plots below. See discussion with the plots below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>INTERPOLATION ISSUES AND THE INTERPOLATION ERROR PARAMETER (IEP)</b><br>\n",
    "The IEP measures the quality of the interpolation scheme for a specific variable on a specific density-temperature grid. Robust interpolation of wide-ranging EOS tables is known to be a difficult problem. Most interpolation schemes individually interpolate each variable, which leads to interpolated states that are not thermodynamically self-consistent. While some thermodynamically consistent interpolation schemes have been developed (e.g., Zeman et al. 2019), they more computationally intensive than simpler interpolation methods and have not been widely implemented yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IEP is calculated on the density-temperature grid using the following method: \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Start with a grid that is twice as dense as the desired final grid and generate an ANEOS density-temperature table.\n",
    "    <li>Split the table into two tables made from the even rows and columns and the odd rows and columns.\n",
    "    <li>Interpolate for the odd index grid values using the even index table.\n",
    "    <li>The IEP is given by (interpolated value-original value)/(original value) of the odd index table.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "A tabulated EOS must be sufficiently densely gridded to capture the phase boundaries. Otherwise, non-physical material response can arise during problems that cross the phase boundary. Simple interpolations schemes generally produce large errors in and near phase boundaries. See illustrative plots below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>We recommend that the interpolation scheme, the implementation of the scheme into EOS code functions (e.g., the source code), and IEP values should be reported in published works that use tabular EOS.</b> See the Jupyter Notebook in the subdirectory and the plots below.\n",

    "This version included Melosh's (2007) treatment for molecular gas and the capability to include a melt curve and solid-solid/liquid-liquid transition (Collins & Melosh LPSC 2014). This version includes an adjustment to the Debye model for the thermal term in the Helmholtz free energy to approach a user-defined heat capacity at high temperatures. The multiplicative factor $f_{cv}$ is entered in input value V44, and the high-temperature heat capacity is $3f_{cv}Nk$.<p>\n",
    "The ANEOSTEST.f routine was modified to output tabulated EOS. Note that the current version of this function sets positive pressures smaller than 1.E-30 GPa equal to 1.E-30 GPa.<br>\n",
    "ANEOS2.f was modified to increase the number of points tabulated on the melt curve in the ANEOS.OUTPUT file and to gather the variables for the heat capacity modification.<br>\n",
    "ANHUG.f was modified to output more Hugoniot points.<br>\n",
    "ANEOS1.f and ANEOS2.f were modified to increase the high temperature limit for the heat capacity (Stewart et al., AIP Conference Proceedings, 2020).<p>\n",

    "<b>FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS</b><br>\n",
    "<ul>\n",

    "<li>Add binary format output for EOS tables.\n",
    "<li>Examine other table interpolation schemes, including thermodynamically self-consistent schemes such as Zeman et al. (2019).\n",
    "<li>Unpublished EOS data were used in the development of this model EOS. These data will be added to future versions of this model development notebook when published.\n",

    "We provide an MDQ rating which is saved as a 301-style SESAME table. The MDQ rating is a qualitative guide for users that provides some known quality control information. This information is necessarily subjective and incomplete. The rating does not guarantee any fidelity in the EOS model except for points that have been directly compared to experimental data in the plots below.<br>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>MDQ=1: Data point has experimental data and falls within experimental error. NOT USED AT THIS TIME. Will be added in the future.\n",
    "    <li>MDQ=0: Data point rating is neutral. The value appears to be a thermodynamically self-consistent model point without known gross errors.\n",
    "    <li>MDQ=-1: Data point rating is erroneous. The value is not thermodynamically correct in a known way. In this work, this flag is used for the replacement values for the tension region to generate an all positive pressure equilibrium EOS table. The current replacement scheme is to use the values in the adjacent grid cell: for each P and T in the sublimation region, use values at the adjacent density with positive pressure. The magnitude of the error is small, but the derivatives in this region will be incorrect.\n",
    "    <li>MDQ=-2: Data point rating is non-physical. The value is not thermodynamically correct in a known way. In this work, this flag is used for ANEOS output with negative values for the specific entropy.\n",
    "    <li>MDQ=-4: Developer judgement that this region of phase space does not provide a robust representation of the material. There are no high-pressure solid phases in this EOS model. Seek alternative models for problems focused in this region.\n",
    "    <li>MDQ=-5: Developer judgement that this region of phase space does not provide a robust representation of the material. Applied to regions with pressures > 2 TPa. The Gruneisen gamma value is too large for liquid in this region and missing physics at higher pressures and temperatures. Seek alternative models for problems focused in this region.\n",
